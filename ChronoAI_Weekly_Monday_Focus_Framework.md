## Weekly Rhythm (Non-Negotiable)

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Monday** | Set 1–2 priorities for the week. Share with CEO (Slack/email/standup). |
| **Tue–Thu** | Execute. No new “priority” unless it replaces one. |
| **Friday** | 15-min check-in: Done / Not done / Blockers. Update for next Monday. |

**Rule:** If it’s not in the Monday focus, it’s not a priority this week.

## ChronoAI Brand Pillars (For Priority-Setting)

Use these when choosing Monday priorities so they ladder to company goals:

| Pillar | Meaning | Example priority |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Automate everything** | Idea → launch → marketing; we are the proof. | Case study: “How we automated X” for a client or internal. |
| **B2B AI solutions** | We sell solutions and capability, not just apps. | One-pager, pitch deck, or sales script for enterprise. |
| **Portfolio products** | Apps demonstrate what we can build. | GodGPT/Lumen/SoulGarden as “built by ChronoAI” story. |
| **Next AI leader in Singapore** | Local credibility, speed, and thought leadership. | One piece of content or one event/partnership that builds that rep. |

**When in doubt:** Pick the one thing that makes ChronoAI more visible or more “automation-first” this week.

---

## Personal Automation Target (Weekly)

**Your rule:** Every week, find and implement **one new thing to automate** (workflow, content, reporting, or ops).

**Good candidates:**
- Content: Changelog → social copy, brief → first-draft post.
- Reporting: Data source → weekly summary or dashboard.
- Ops: Inbox/forms → task creation, approval flows.
- Brand: Naming/brief → first-draft positioning or messaging.

**Friday check-in:** Always answer: “What did I automate this week?” and “What will I automate next week?”

---

## Shift: GodGPT → ChronoAI

| Before (GodGPT-focused) | After (ChronoAI-focused) |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Single product brand    | Company brand + portfolio products |
| Consumer / spiritual wellness | B2B AI solutions + apps as proof |
| Product marketing      | Brand + company narrative + demand |

**Monday priorities should favor:** ChronoAI narrative, B2B positioning, “automate everything” proof points, and Singapore AI leadership. GodGPT/Lumen stay as portfolio proof, not the main weekly focus unless explicitly agreed.

---

## Quick Reference

- **Monday:** Set 1–2 priorities + 1 automation target. Share with CEO.
- **Friday:** 15-min check-in. Done / not done / blockers. Draft next Monday.
- **Personal:** One new automation every week.
- **North star:** ChronoAI = the cool company that automates everything, from idea to launch to marketing — next AI leader in Singapore.
