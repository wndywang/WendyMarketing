## Slide 2: SoulGarden — Execute Marketing + Pass Gate 1

**Status:** Live on App Store. GTM timeline approved. This week = 100% focus on marketing execution.

**Execute (from Organic Growth Strategy):**
- **ASO:** Lock title (≤30 chars), subtitle, 5–7 keywords, screenshot order + captions. Treat ASO as product.
- **Content:** One platform (TikTok or Reels) + 3–5 posts scheduled or published. Hook → Problem → Solution → CTA.
- **Community:** 5 subreddits/groups (e.g. r/Manifestation, r/ADHD) — help first, soft mention when relevant. 5–10 genuine comments.
- **Shareability:** Plan in-app share moments (e.g. after plant stage change) and share-card design.

**Gate 1 (Usage Gate, 0–2 months) — Must pass to proceed:**

| Criteria | Target | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Primary — Active users** | ≥200 users completing core task | Analytics |
| **Social followers** | ≥500 | Channel dashboards |
| **D7 retention (batch)** | ≥40% | Cohort analysis |
| **Usage frequency** | ≥2 uses/week avg | Behavior data |
| **User feedback** | ≥20 spontaneous pieces | Reviews, support, surveys |
| **Use case concentration** | One clear dominant use case | Interviews |

**Pass** = proceed to Gate 2. **Fail** = pivot or kill. No illusion — real validation.

## Slide 3: New Marketing SaaS — PRCA Teaser & Feedback

**Goal:** Tease the new Marketing SaaS at PRCA conference. Build connections. Get feedback to develop the product.

**This week:**
- **Teaser asset:** 1 slide or 1-pager that answers: *What is it? Who is it for? What problem does it solve?* No full product — enough to spark “tell me more.”
- **PRCA:** Use the teaser in conversations. Collect: (1) “Would you use this?” (2) “What’s missing?” (3) “Who else should I talk to?”
- **Outcome:** Leads, brands, potential clients + qualitative feedback for product development.

**Positioning (teaser):** ChronoAI builds AI solutions for B2B. This product automates [marketing workflow / idea-to-launch]. We’re the company that automates everything — this is the next piece.

**Friday result:** Teaser ready + list of PRCA contacts and 3–5 feedback notes.

## Slide 4: Business Expansion — This Week’s Targets

| Stream | This week’s expansion target |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| **SoulGarden** | **Community & users:** Grow installs, followers (≥500), and engagement. Execute organic plan so we hit Gate 1 (200+ users, 40% D7, 20+ feedback). Community = Reddit, groups, email, UGC. |
| **New Marketing SaaS** | **Leads, brands, potential clients:** PRCA teaser + conversations. Capture contacts, interest, and feedback. One clear “next step” (e.g. demo, beta, call) for each hot lead. |

**One number to watch:** SoulGarden → Gate 1 metrics. SaaS → number of quality conversations and captured leads at PRCA.

## Slide 5: Summary & Friday Check-In

**Monday focus (2 March):**
1. **SoulGarden:** Execute organic marketing plan (ASO + content + community). Track toward Gate 1.
2. **Marketing SaaS:** Finalize PRCA teaser. Use conference for connections and feedback.

**Friday check-in (6 March):**
- SoulGarden: [ ] ASO/content/community deliverables done? [ ] Gate 1 metrics update (users, D7, followers, feedback).
- SaaS: [ ] Teaser live at PRCA? [ ] Leads/contacts + feedback notes captured?

**Rule (PRC):** We’re not building what we think is cool. We’re building what the market validates — usage, then payment, then growth. Kill illusions fast; double down on reality.
